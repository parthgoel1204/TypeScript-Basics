// Typescript is often called the "SUPERSET" of JavaScript.

// It allows the developers to write JS in a precise manner so that the code faces a lot less error in the runtime.
// TYpeScript all about type safety 
// In the JS we can add 2 + '2' = "22";
// The above was possible because "TYPESAFETY" was missing .

// TypeScript does "STATIC CHECKING" which means the parser of the language ot the entire syntax of the language is constantly being analyzed by the IDE'S

// We write our code in TS and that is further transpiled into JS.
// TypeScript is just a development tool and our whole code that we sent to the production is 100% JS.
// It helps to write better code with less problems with a more scalable and maintainable code that is easily understandable and the chances of it producing errors are very less.
// It's more of a wrapper around JS.
